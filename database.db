{"college":"Santa Cruz","title":"(Slightly) Excited Frosh","post":"My very long list of woods and grasses allergies is very excited (not really) to be at UCSC (hopefully) in spring quarter. Not gonna lie, the campus feels like a national park with all the trees and slopes everywhere but I actually kind of like it. And I'm very excited to be hiking to class everyday and write code in a forest. ","timestamp":1596081731137,"_id":"2O4siokEwAYQA9gP"}
{"college":"","title":"RIP Professor","post":"I was recently enrolled in a class and the professor died. I think he was around 80 years old. Very sad, but I heard he was horrible so at least I avoided an potential F from him. ","timestamp":1596085290926,"_id":"BkPacdk7yCNaEuIt"}

{"college":"","title":"I Replaced My Roommate","post":"Story is that I connected with someone on the internet to room with, but then I applied for a new roommate without her knowing because I thought she was too much for me. I didn't want her to know that I applied in case the application was denied. She was a bit over-friendly, and I was afraid she would bring too many people over at our dorm. When my roommate application was accepted, she happened to be texting me about how excited she was to meet me. When I broke the news to her, she was shattered.","timestamp":1596084761900,"_id":"sYgNa1Y5iiFobr29"}
